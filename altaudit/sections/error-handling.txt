How Sections Handle Errors

Error handling in each section has to keep the following in mind: Any exception thrown will rollback the character,
preventing any changes from being made. We only want this to happen in cases where something is so wrong, we wouldn't
want to update the character. For example, most of the character's "basic" info should be there, otherwise it is
pointless to try to update other information. Also, errors should only happen from missing items in the api response,
not from divide-by-zero or other common errors.


Basic

Almost any missing keys in this section should throw an exception. The only exception to this rule is mainspec,
as this is not vital and may not appear on lower level characters (I'm not 100% sure of that, but just in case).
Missing active spec should be None.

Items

If the top level 'equipped_items' is missing, an exception should be thrown. A slot without a ['slot']['type']
should also thrown an exception. A missing ['level']['value'] key should result in an ilvl of 0. Otherwise no
exception should happen. Missing items should count as 0 in estimated ilvl, but should otherwise be None in
the various item fields.

Azerite

Similar to Items, only missing 'equipped_items' or missing slot should trigger an exception. Any issues should
result in values of None being placed in the respective field.

Audit

Similar to Items, only missing 'equipped_items' or missing slot should trigger an exception.
Similar to Items, only missing 'equipped_items' should trigger an exception. Missing enchants are already accounted
for and common. Missing names on enchants should result in string of "Unknown". Missing enchant ID should result in
ID of None, name of "Unknown", quality of 1 and icon of None.
